    //REDUCED METHOD 
    //works bit differently form the filter and the map method
    //it doesnt necessarily a new array instead it returns a single value which could be a number or string
    //any values you want based in the value we iterate over array
    
    //for example how many of values in scores are above fifly for eg: 3 values are over fifty
    const scores = [10,20,60,40,70,90,30];
    
    const result = scores.reduce((acc,curr)=>{  //reduce takes 2 params (accumulator,currentValuee)
        if(curr>50){
            acc++;
        }
        return acc;
    },0);   //start accumulator from zero first time we fire callback function  -->accumulator remembers value each time we fire callback function

console.log(`There are ${result} numbers greater than 50 in array ${scores}`);


//EXAMPLE 2

const scores1 =[
    {player:'mario',score:50},
    {player:'yoshi',score:30},
    {player:'mario',score:70},   //,mario played again and got 70
    {player:'crystal',score:60},
    {player:'mario',score:70}, //mario played again

];

//we want to add all scores of mario
const marioTotal = scores1.reduce((acc,curr)=>{
    if(curr.player==='mario'){
        acc += curr.score;
    }
    return acc;
},0);

console.log('Total score of mario ',marioTotal);
