    <h2>Prototype Model</h2>
    <!--! defining methods inside the constroctors is not the best way to add them-->
    <!-- ? because everytime inatance is created they create copy of all methods with them instead of pointing the same method one classes or user -->
    <!--* so we create protorype of particular class or constructor so that every instancecs will share one copy of common methods -->
    <!-- * all methods are available inside proto property and every obj in js has prototype for ge: the proto property for an array object will point to array prototype(methods)-->
    <!-- todo: so we create define our methods inside proto insted of directly putting it to classes or constructor -->
