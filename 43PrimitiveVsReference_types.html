In javascript:


PRIMITIVE types are:    -->variable stored on stack (less space available)
numbers 
string
booleans 
null
undefined
symbols


REFERENCE types are:   -->object stored on heap  (more space available)
-all types of objects types
 -object literals
 -arrays
 -functions
 -dates
 -all other objects (eg:math objects)


 what is the difference between primitive types and reference typee??
 -it all about how they are stored and used in memory


 eg:
 const userOne = {name:'Shaun',score:100};
 const userTwo = userOne;   //both will get same pointer from stack of one object stored in heap 
 const userOne = {name:'Shaun',score:50}; //now userTwo will also get changed as they refer to same pointer
 //so we dont make a copy of actual data in reference type but a copy of pointer of  objects
