//*if i wanted to create another user with same kind of properties...dont you think it would be redundant...for eg:
const userTwo = {
    username: 'shyam',
    login(){
        console.log(this.username + " is logged in...");
    }
}
userTwo.login();

//so obj literal method seems to be little boring here so we use class User and call it constructor 
//eveerytime we create new user we call constructor for eg:
const userThree = new User('sita');

//every user created with User class would have the methods and properties class have
