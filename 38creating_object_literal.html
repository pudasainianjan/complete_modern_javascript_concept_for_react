    /* INTRODUCTION TO OBJECT
    object in real life have properties color size model  
    eg: phone object: prooperties: color,size,model,etc also has things it can do, it can ring, take picture, play music
    user object: email,usermane,gender   and things it can do is simply METHODS(eg:login,logout)
    blog object: properties: title,content,author  and Methods(things it can do) : publish, unpublish,delete
    js also has some built in objects such as day object, math object,etc
    */

    //OBJECT LITERAL NOTATION -->for creating objects
    let user =  {
        name : 'Crystal',   //key: 'value' -->one of the property of user object
        age: 30,
        email: 'crystal@gmail.com',
        location: 'france',
        blogs: ['10 things to do in life','how to make tea']
    };

    console.log(user);
    console.log(user.name);  //accessing property
    user.age= 35;
    console.log(user.age);
    //also square bracket can be used instead of dot to access properties
    console.log(user['name']);
    console.log(user['email']);
    console.log('Previous Name: ',user['name']);
    user['name'] = 'chau chau';
    //console.log('lastest name: ',user[name]);  wrong one use double comma
    console.log('Previous Name: ',user['name']);

    //generally dot notaion is easy to use but when we want to pass some variables then use bracket one for eg:
    const key = 'location';
    console.log(user[key]);  //same as doing user['location']

    //TYPE OF OPERATOR -->for showing type of obj properties
    console.log('The datatype of user is:' ,typeof user);
