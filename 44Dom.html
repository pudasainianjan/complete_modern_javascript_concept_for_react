    /*DOM EXPLAINED */   //dom is created by a browser 
    /*
    once the html document is loaded in the browser, the browser creates an object which models this document and this object is called the 
    'document' object
    doucument obj also contains different properties and methods eg: console.log(document.location);
    document.url,
    Methods Like:
    document.getElementById();
    document.getElementByClassName();

    inside javascript we have access to that document object adn we can use it to interact with html pages using those different methods and properties
