    //Introduction to http req.
/*  make http request to get data from server  
    we make the requests to API endpoints  -->pparticular server exposes to us so we can use their api ...for eg:www.musicapi.com/artist/moby
    API sends data as a response when request is made to the endpoint
    we typically get data in a json format

    //json placeholder website used for api
    //we generally want to get data we make get request, and sometimes we make post req for getting like username / password
    */

    //MAKING A REQUEST WITH JS CODE
    
    const request = new XMLHttpRequest(); //creates req. object  //this xml represents old data format we used before json arrived but this can req. can work with any kind of data format now like xml,json,plain text,etc

    request.addEventListener('readystatechange',()=>{  //fires everytime the state change in the request ....state change means request is going through different phases(4 total)
    //console.log(request,request.readyState); //everytime readystatechange it will log to console
    if(request.readyState === 4){
        console.log(request.responseText);  //property contains response data
    }
       
   })
   //ready state 0 when open has not called
    
    request.open('GET','https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/');  //readystate 1 when called open    //open method takes 2 arguments ('typeOfRequest',what is the endpoint we want data from?)

    request.send(); //readystate 2 when send()
    //readystate 3 when downloading some response text
    //readystate 4 when operation is complete  -->here we receive data and do something
